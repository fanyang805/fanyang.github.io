Reinforcement learning is unstable and even diverge when a nonlinear function approximator such as neural network is used to represent the action-value (Q function). The causes are the correlations present in the sequence of observations. Small updates to Q may significantly change the policy and change the data distribution, the correlations between action-value (Q) and target value.

Two key ideas are used to address the correlation:  
(1) Replay buffer.  
(2) Update the target value periodically instead of every iteration.
