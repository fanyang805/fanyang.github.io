title: System Monitor 
description: |
 The system monitor for linux operation system. It provides information such as cpu usage, memory usage, processes information. The program reads system information from various files in directories like /proc/ and /etc/, computes parameters and shows them in a graphic interface in terminal.

In this project, I created a simple system monitor using c++. As shown in figure below, the system monitor provides the system information and processes information.

<div class="row justify-content-center">
    <div class="col-8">
          <img class="img-fluid z-depth-1" src="{{ '/projects/Cpp/assets/img/system-monitor/system_monitor.png' | relative_url }}" alt=""/>
    </div>
</div>
<br/>

The information is obtained from files in linux system. The path of these directories are presented in the table below.

| Info | directory path  |
| ----- | - |
| OS | `/etc/os-release` |
| Kernal    | `/proc/version` |
| CPU | `/proc/stat` |
| Memory | `/proc/meminfo`
| Total Processes | `/proc/stat`|
| Running Processes | `/proc/stat`|
| Up Time | `/proc/uptime` |

<br/>
Note that the memory usage shown in this system monitor is non-cache/buffer memory.

The files containing processes information are located in `/proc/` directory. The PID is shown as the directory name in `/proc/`. 

| Info         | directory path                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| USER         | `/proc/[pid]/status`, `/etc/passwd`|
| CPU Usage    | `/proc/[pid]/stat`                 |
| Memory Usage | `/proc/[pid]/status`               |
| Up Time      | `/proc/[pid]/stat`                 |
| Command      | `/proc/[pid]/cmdline`              |

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling

This project requires [ncurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) for displaying outputs. Install this library by command in terminal:  
`sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`.

After installation of dependencies, clone this project and create build directory in root of the project.  
`mkdir build && cd build`.

Then run `cmake ..` and `make` in `build` directory. 

### Running

The executable is in `results/` directory. To run the system monitor, go to root directory of the project and run command:  
`./results/monitor`.
