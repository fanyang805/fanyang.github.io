Particle filter is a nonparametric filter which represents the posterior by a set of weighted samples. Since the functional form of the posterior is not needed, it can model arbitrary distribution, e.g., non-Gaussian distributions. 

In this project, a complete particle filter is implemented using Python. Given the range-only sensor readings, odometry of robot and the ground-truth position of landmarks<sup>[1]</sup>, robot uses a set of particles to represent the possible poses and an arrow to represent the average coordinates.

## Particle Filter Overview

Particle filter is an implementation of recursive Bayesian filter below:

$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
bel(x_t) &= p(x_t|z_{1:t}, u_{1:t}) \\
 & = \eta P(z_t|x_t) \int_{x_{t-1}} P(x_t|x_{t-1}, u_t) bel(x_{t-1}) \mathrm{d}x_{t-1}
 \end{split}
 \end{equation*}
$$

The posterior $$p(x_t|z_{1:t}, u_{1:t})$$ is represented by a set of weighted samples, i.e.,
$$\chi = \{\langle x^{[j]}, w^{[j]} \rangle\}_{j=1,...,M}$$ 

1. In each time step, the particles are propagated based on the motion model 
   $$P(x_t|x_{t-1}, u_t)$$.  
2. Then they are weighted according to the likelihood of the observation 
   $$P(z_t|x_t)$$.  
3. In the resampling step (importance sampling essentially), new particles are draw with a probability proportional to the weights, which account for the difference between the proposal and target distribution.

The pseudocode[2] is presented below:

## Code Explanation

There are three key functions in this implementation.

1. `sample_motion_model(odometry, particles)`: take as inputs the odometry and the current set of particles, sample new particles based on the odometry motion model and the motion noise. The pseudocode<sup>[2]</sup> is presented below.

2. `eval_sensor_model(sensor_data, particles, landmarks)`: given the sensor readings, partcles sampled from motion model, the ground-truth position of landmarks, measurement noise, compute the weights of samples from observation models, i.e., 
   $$w_t = P(z_t|x_t)$$. 

3. `resample_particles(particles, weights)`: draw with replacement $$M$$ (size of particle set) particles from the given set with probability equal to the weight. The resampling is implemented by the low variance resampling with linear complexity.
